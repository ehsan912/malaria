Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited blood disorders that causes the red blood cells (RBCs) to have abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S. People with the disease have RBCs which are crescent-shaped, sticky, and rigid. The affected individual is likely to have blocked blood vessels and a variety of other problems ranging from pain to infections.

Sickle cell trait is a genetic condition that refers to the individual inheriting both the sickle cell gene (hemoglobin S) and the normal hemoglobin gene (hemoglobin A). Individuals with sickle cell trait do not show any symptoms compared to those with sickle cell disease. Moreover, they show partial resistance to malaria as malarial parasites (*Plasmodium*) find it harder to grow inside their RBCs.

**Heterozygote Advantage**

Heterozygote advantage refers to a situation where individuals who are heterozygous (having two different alleles) for a particular gene have a higher fitness than those who are homozygous (having two copies of the same allele). In the case of sickle cell disease, individuals with one sickle cell allele (HbS) and one normal allele (HbA) have increased resistance to malaria compared to those with two normal alleles (HbAA).

Malaria is caused by the *Plasmodium* parasite, which infects red blood cells. The sickle cell trait (HbAS) provides a survival advantage in malaria-endemic regions because the altered shape of the sickle-shaped red blood cells makes it harder for the parasite to infect and survive. As a result, individuals with the sickle cell trait are less likely to suffer severe malaria.

In regions with high malaria prevalence, the sickle cell allele (HbS) is maintained in the population because heterozygotes (HbAS) have a survival advantage. This selective pressure increases the frequency of the HbS allele in these regions. However, individuals who are homozygous for the sickle cell allele (HbSS) suffer from sickle cell disease, which can be debilitating and even life-threatening. Therefore, the HbA allele is also maintained in the population to prevent the high prevalence of sickle cell disease.

The heterozygote advantage helps maintain genetic diversity within the population. By providing a survival advantage to heterozygotes, it ensures that both the HbA and HbS alleles persist in the gene pool. This genetic diversity is beneficial for the population's adaptability to changing environments and resistance to diseases.
